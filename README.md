<p align="center">
    A system designed to modernize the monitoring of water sources in the national parks and game reserves of Southern Africa with a focus on reliability and efficiency. E-Park uses IoT devices to remotely manage this often overlooked part of park maintenance. It makes use of smart algorithms and artificial intelligence to predict scenarios in order to stay ahead of the curb, potentially preventing disaster while also making the jobs of park rangers and conservationists easier as well as lowering costs by eliminating unnecessary inspections and maintenance.
